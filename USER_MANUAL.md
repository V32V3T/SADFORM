## 3. Finding Music Recommendations

### 3.2. Inputting a Song

- On the recommendation page, you will find an input field or a search bar.
- Type the name of a song you enjoy into this field.
- As you type, the system may provide search suggestions to help you find the exact track.

### 3.3. Viewing Recommendations

- After submitting your chosen song, the system will display a list of recommended tracks.
- The input song you selected will often be displayed prominently, perhaps with its album art and an option to play a preview or listen on Spotify.
- Below or alongside the input song, you will see a collection of recommended songs.
- Each recommended song will typically show:
    - Track Title
    - Artist Name(s)
    - Album Art (if available)
    - An option to play a preview or listen on Spotify (often an embedded player or a direct link).

## 4. Understanding the Interface

- **Input Song Display**: The song you've chosen as a base for recommendations. It usually includes:
    - Album art.
    - Song title and artist.
    - A Spotify player embed or a "Listen on Spotify" button.
- **Recommendations List/Grid**: A collection of songs suggested by the system.
    - Each item is typically a card or list entry with song details and playback options.
- **Navigation Bar**: Usually at the top of the page, providing links to different sections like Home, Recommendations, Profile, Logout, etc.
- **Search Bar/Input Field**: Where you type the name of the song to get recommendations.

## 5. Interacting with Recommendations

- **Listen on Spotify**: Click the "Listen on Spotify" button or a similar link to open the full song on the Spotify platform (this may require you to have a Spotify account).
- **Explore Further**: If you like a recommended song, you can often use that song as a new input to get further recommendations, creating a chain of music discovery.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **No Recommendations Found**: 
    - Ensure the song title is spelled correctly.
    - The song might not be in the database, or it might be too obscure. Try a more popular song.


## 7. Logging Out

- When you are finished using the application, it's good practice to log out.
- Look for a **"Logout"** or **"Sign Out"** button, usually in the navigation bar or user profile menu.
